# robofriends-ci
Continuous Integration for robofriends app!

I used this code from a Udemy course by Andrei Neagoie. I implemented the CI/CD process in this code by using Circle Ci.
Circle Ci  takes cares of building the code and running tests. It is automatically deloye dto the circel Ci hosting site.
The mai content of my work can be found on the .yml file in this code.
I built the .yml file and changed it many times until it passed the testing.
Te tests I did are here https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/Pauneren?invite=true
In order to access to the circleci project you need to accept the invitation to this project on github
